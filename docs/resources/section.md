# phpipam_section

The `phpipam_section` resource manages a PHPIPAM section - a top-level category that subnets and IP addresses are entered into. Use this resource if you want to manage a section entirely from Terraform. If you just need to get information on a section use the `phpipam_section` data source instead.
