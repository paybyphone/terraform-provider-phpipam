# phpipam_subnet

The `phpipam_subnet` resource can be used to create and manage a subnet in PHPIPAM. Use it to manage details on subnets you create in Terraform for other things, such as storing the IDs of the subnets you create for AWS, or for a full top-down management of subnets and IP addresses in Terraform. If you just need to get information on a subnet, use the `phpipam_subnet` data source instead.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "phpipam_section" "section" {
  name = "Customers"
}

resource "phpipam_subnet" "subnet" {
  section_id     = data.phpipam_section.section.section_id
  subnet_address = "10.10.3.0"
  subnet_mask    = 24

  custom_fields = {
    CustomTestSubnets = "terraform-test"
  }
}
```

* `nameserver_id` - (Optional) The ID of the nameserver used to assign PTR records for this subnet.
* `show_name` - (Optional) True if the subnet name is are shown in the section, instead of the network address.
* `create_ptr_records` - (Optional) True if PTR records are created for addresses in this subnet.
* `display_hostnames` - (Optional) True if hostnames are displayed instead of IP addresses in the address listing for this subnet.
* `allow_ip_requests` - (Optional) True if the subnet allows IP requests in PHPIPAM.

~> Custom fields: PHPIPAM installations with custom fields must have all fields set to optional when using this plugin. For more info see here. Further to this, either ensure that your fields also do not have default values, or ensure the default is set in your TF configuration. Diff loops may happen otherwise!
