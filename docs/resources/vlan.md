# phpipam_vlan

The `phpipam_vlan` resource can be used to manage a VLAN on PHPIPAM. Use it to set up a VLAN through Terraform, or update details such as its name or description. If you are just looking for information on a VLAN, use the `phpipam_vlan` data source instead.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "phpipam_vlan" "vlan" {
  name        = "tf-test"
  number      = 1000
  description = "Managed by Terraform"

  custom_fields = {
    CustomTestVLANs = "terraform-test"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The resource takes the following parameters:

* `name` - (Required) The name/label of the VLAN.
* `number` - (Required) The number of the VLAN (the actual VLAN ID on your switch).
* `l2_domain_id` - (Optional) The layer 2 domain ID in the PHPIPAM database.
* `description` - (Optional) The description supplied to the VLAN.
* `edit_date` - (Optional) The date this resource was last updated.
* `custom_fields` - (Optional) A key/value map of custom fields for this VLAN.

~> Custom fields: PHPIPAM installations with custom fields must have all fields set to optional when using this plugin. For more info see here. Further to this, either ensure that your fields also do not have default values, or ensure the default is set in your TF configuration. Diff loops may happen otherwise!

## Attribute Reference

* `vlan_id` - The ID of the VLAN to look up. NOTE: this is the database ID, not the VLAN number - if you need this, use the number parameter.
* `edit_date` - The date this resource was last updated.
