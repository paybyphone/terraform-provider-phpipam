# phpipam_section

The `phpipam_section` data source allows one to look up a specific section, either by database ID or name. This data can then be used to manage other parts of PHPIPAM, such as in the event that the section name is known but not its ID, which is required for managing subnets.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "phpipam_section" "section" {
  name = "Customers"
}

resource "phpipam_subnet" "subnet" {
  section_id = data.phpipam_section.section.section_id
  subnet_address = "10.10.3.0"
  subnet_mask = 24
}
```

## Argument Reference

The data source takes the following parameters:

* `section_id` - The ID of the section to look up.
* `name` - The name of the section to look up.

One of `section_id` or `name` must be supplied. If both are supplied, `section_id` is used.
