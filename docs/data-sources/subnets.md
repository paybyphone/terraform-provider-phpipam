# phpipam_subnets

The `phpipam_subnets` data source allows you to search for subnets, much in the same way as you can in the single-form `phpipam_subnet` data source. However, multiple subnets are returned from this data source as a single list of subnet IDs as they are found in the PHPIPAM database. You can then use the single-form `phpipam_subnet` data source to extract the subnet data for each matched network in the database.

## Example Usage

Simple:
```hcl
data "phpipam_subnets" "subnet_search" {
  subnet_id = 3

  custom_field_filter {
    CustomTestSubnets = ".*terraform.*"
  }
}

data "phpipam_subnet" "subnets" {
  count     = length(data.phpipam_subnets.subnet_search.subnet_ids)
  subnet_id = element(data.phpipam_subnets.subnet_search.subnet_ids, count.index)
}

output "subnet_addresses" {
  value = data.phpipam_subnet.subnets.*.ip_address
}

output "subnet_cidrs" {
  value = formatlist("%s/%d", data.phpipam_subnet.subnets.*.subnet_address, data.phpipam_subnet.subnets.*.subnet_mask)
}
```

## Argument Reference

The data source takes the following parameters:

* `section_id` - (Required) The ID of the section of the subnet.

One of the following below parameters is required:

* `description` - The subnet's description.
* `description_match` - A regular expression to match against when searching for a subnet.
* `custom_field_filter` - A map of custom fields to search for. The filter values are regular expressions. All fields need to match for the match to succeed.

You can find documentation for the regular expression syntax used with the description_match and `custom_field_filter` attributes here.

~> An empty or unspecified `custom_field_filter` value is the equivalent to a regular expression that matches everything, and hence will return all subnets that contain the referenced custom field key!

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `subnet_ids` - A list of subnet IDs that match the given criteria.
