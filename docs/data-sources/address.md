# phpipam_address

The `phpipam_address` data source allows one to get information about a specific IP address within PHPIPAM. Use this address to get general information about a specific IP address such as its host name, description and more.

Lookups for IP addresses can only happen at this time via its entry in the database, or the IP address itself. Future versions of this resource, when such features become generally available in the PHPIPAM API, will allow lookup based on host name, allowing for better ability for this resource to discover IP addresses that have been pre-assigned for a specific resource.

## Example Usage

Simple:

```hcl
data "phpipam_address" "address" {
  ip_address = "10.10.1.1"
}

output "address_description" {
  value = data.phpipam_address.address.description
}
```

With `description`:
```hcl
data "phpipam_address" "address" {
  subnet_id         = 3
  description_match = "Customer 1"
}

output "address_description" {
  value = data.phpipam_address.address.description
}
```

With `custom_field_filter`:
```hcl
data "phpipam_address" "address" {
  subnet_id = 3
  custom_field_filter {
    CustomTestAddresses = ".*terraform.*"
  }
}

output "address_description" {
  value = data.phpipam_address.address.description
}
```

## Argument Reference

The data source takes the following parameters:

* `address_id` - The ID of the IP address in the PHPIPAM database.
* `ip_address` - The actual IP address in PHPIPAM.
* `subnet_id` - The ID of the subnet that the address resides in. This is required to search on the description or hostname fields.
* `description` - The description of the IP address. subnet_id is required when using this field.
* `hostname` - The host name of the IP address. subnet_id is required when using this field.
* `custom_field_filter` - A map of custom fields to search for. The filter values are regular expressions that follow the RE2 syntax for which you can find documentation here. All fields need to match for the match to succeed.

~> `description`, `hostname`, and `custom_field_filter` fields return the first match found without any warnings. If you are looking to return multiple addresses, combine this data source with the phpipam_addresses data source.

~> An empty or unspecified `custom_field_filter` value is the equivalent to a regular expression that matches everything, and hence will return the first address it sees in the subnet.

-> Arguments are processed in the following order of precedence: `address_id`, `ip_address`, `subnet_id`, and either one of `description`, `hostname`, or `custom_field_filter`

## Attribute Reference
